# To-Do-List
# Task List Project

This is a simple task list app where you can add and delete tasks dynamically using JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.
3. Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it from the list.

## How It Works

- The JavaScript function `deleteTask(button)` removes the `<li>` element containing the clicked "Delete" button.
